 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The voting system program is designed to, given an input file reprsenting
 * an open party list(OPL) or closed party list(CPL) election tabulate votes
 * for individuals or parties, depending on input voting type, and output the results
 * of the election along with an audit file, detailing the exact steps taken to decide 
 * winner(s) to ensure accuracy, and a media file to deliver to media parties.

 * \subsection opl_def_sec OPL type voting
 * 
 * In a open party list system voters  express a
 * preference for particular candidates, not just parties. It is designed to give voters some say over the order of the list
 * and thus which candidates get elected. One version of this is illustrated in the ballot below. Voters are presented with
 * unordered or random lists of candidates chosen in party primaries. Voters cannot vote for a party directly, but must
 * cast a vote for an individual candidate. This vote counts for the specific candidate as well as for the party. So the order
 * of the final list completely depends on the number of votes won by each candidate on the list. The most popular
 * candidates rise to the top of the list and have a better chance of being elected. 
 * 
 * \subsection cpl_def_sec CPL type voting
 * 
 * In a closed party list system the party fixes the order in which the candidates are listed and elected, and the voter simply casts a vote
 * for the party as a whole. This is shown in the first ballot below, which illustrates an election for the House of
 * Representatives in a five-seat district. Voters are not able to indicate their preference for any candidates on the list, but
 * must accept the list in the order presented by the party. Winning candidates are selected in the exact order they appear
 * on the original list. So in the example here, if the Democrats won two seats, the first two candidates on the pre-ordered
 * list--Foster and Rosen-Amy--would be elected.
